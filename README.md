University 1st Year Group Project

Discord ChatBot - Utilising Application Programming Interfaces (API)

APIs used include:
- Google Time Zone
- Google Maps
- Open Weather


Aim:
- To create a chatbot within Discord which will converse with the user. Features include, answering questions and other general daily conversations.

What I accomplished:
- HTML scraped the Google Maps website to insert a postcode passed from a Discord Channel.
- Utilised Google Places API to efficiently request any given global location and return the Google Maps URL of the location to a Discord channel.
- Applied Google Time Zone API to request and return a given global location's timezone and currrent time.
- Combined Google Places API and Open Weather API, to create a real-time weather channel within a Discord server.
